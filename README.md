# GOONSTATION 2016 #
# But not really #

This *was* the Official release of goonstation from 2016-03-04, based
on revision 35cd644. The rest of the original README is continued
below.

It's been chopped about since then, with some fixes (and some heinous
bodges) to make it compile & run under byond 516.

Do feel free to poke at fixing other bits if you want, but it's mostly
for hysterical interest.
